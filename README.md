# Jigsaw puzzle solver
This package contains a linear programming-based solver for jigsaw puzzle 
problems.

The solver based on linear programming is implemented from the paper by 
Yu et al. (2015). This package implements the 'free' strategy and can only 
solve Type I problems (i.e. problems where the orientation of the pieces is 
known).
